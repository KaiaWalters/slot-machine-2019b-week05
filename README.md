# Description
Slot Machine is a web application that, upon pressing a button, randomizes 5 items on three wheels. Users are able to place a bet of 5 or 50 dollars. Feeling lucky?

## How its Made
This project involved the use of HTML CSS and Java Script.Java Script played a large part in the creation of this project. Math.random()was used to randomize the results of each wheel. This meant that whena user clicked a button each of the three "wheels" would crank out a different result. The if loops determined what result would be attributed to the random decimal that Math.Random() produced via if statements. 

## What I Learned
When tackling this project, the greatest challenge was using pseudo coding the functions that would come together to make the slot machine.
